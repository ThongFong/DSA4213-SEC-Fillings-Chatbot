This increase was driven by strong demand in the Client and Gaming segment, particularly for AMD Ryzen\u2122 processors, semi-custom game console SoCs, and Radeon\u2122 gaming GPUs, as well as an increase in the Data Center segment due to demand for AMD EPYC\u2122 processors and AMD Instinct\u2122 MI350 Series GPUs (Source 3).\n- AMD's gross margin for the same period was 52%, up from 50% in the prior year period, primarily due to product mix (Source 3).\n\nIn summary, both NVIDIA and AMD experienced growth in their respective revenue streams, with NVIDIA showing a significant portion of its revenue coming from international sales and specific large customers, while AMD demonstrated a substantial year-over-year increase in net revenue driven by strong demand across multiple product segments.",

            "answer": "To compare the revenue trends of NVIDIA and AMD using their 10-Q reports, we need to generally understand their financial performance over recent quarters. Here's a broad overview based on patterns observed in recent years:\n\n1. **NVIDIA**:\n   - **Growth Drivers**: NVIDIA has experienced significant revenue growth due to its leadership in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, a surge in demand for gaming hardware, and expansion into data centers and artificial intelligence (AI). The company's focus on AI and machine learning, particularly in data centers, has been a major revenue driver.\n   - **Recent Trends**: The company has reported substantial increases in revenue, particularly from its data center segment, driven by strong demand for GPU accelerators used in AI and high-performance computing. Gaming remains a critical segment, although it can be more cyclical and tied to consumer trends.\n\n2. **AMD (Advanced Micro Devices)**:\n   - **Growth Drivers**: AMD's revenue growth has been fueled by its advancements in CPU and GPU technologies, gaining market share from competitors like Intel in the CPU space. The introduction of its Ryzen processors and EPYC server processors has been pivotal for revenue growth.\n   - **Recent Trends**: AMD has shown strong revenue growth in both its computing and graphics segment, as well as its enterprise, embedded, and semi-custom segment. The company's competitive offerings have helped it expand its customer base and increase its market share.\n\n**Comparison**:\n- **Both companies** have benefited from the rise in demand for gaming, cloud computing, AI, and data center technologies.\n- **NVIDIA** tends to lead in the GPU space, especially for AI applications, while **AMD** has made significant strides in the CPU market, challenging Intel with its competitive products.\n- **NVIDIA's revenue growth** is often driven by advances in GPU technology and increased adoption in data centers, while **AMD** benefits from competitive CPU offerings and gains in both consumer and enterprise markets.\n\nTo obtain a detailed, up-to-date comparison, reviewing the latest 10-Q reports filed by each company would provide specific figures and insights into their quarterly performance and market strategies.",

            "answer": "To find out how Microsoft's operating income has changed over the last year, you would need to review the company's quarterly earnings reports, specifically the 10-Q filings submitted to the SEC. These reports provide detailed financial statements, including the income statement where operating income is reported.\n\nIn these filings, you would compare the operating income for the most recent quarters with those from the same quarters in the previous year. This comparison would show any year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter changes in operating income, indicating whether it has increased, decreased, or remained stable.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend accessing Microsoft's latest 10-Q filings directly from the SEC's EDGAR database or the Investor Relations section of Microsoft's website.

        "ticker_filter_manual": null,
        "response": {
            "answer": "To calculate the gross profit margin for all companies, you would typically need to aggregate data from the individual 10-Q reports (quarterly financial statements) that companies submit to the SEC. Each company's 10-Q report provides details specific to that company's financial performance, including revenues and cost of goods sold (COGS), which are necessary for calculating the gross profit margin.\n\nThe gross profit margin is calculated as:\n\n\\[ \\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)}}{\\text{Revenue}}\\right) \\times 100 \\]\n\nSince I don't have access to specific 10-Q data or the capability to conduct live data aggregation from the SEC filings across all companies, I can't provide an exact gross profit margin for all companies. Analysts typically calculate this margin individually for each company and then might compute an average or median for a specific industry or sector. For a comprehensive and aggregated view, financial databases or financial data aggregators would be used to compile this data from multiple companies' reports.",

This increase was driven by strong demand in the Client and Gaming segment, particularly for AMD Ryzen\u2122 processors, semi-custom game console SoCs, and Radeon\u2122 gaming GPUs, as well as an increase in the Data Center segment due to demand for AMD EPYC\u2122 processors and AMD Instinct\u2122 MI350 Series GPUs (Source 4).\n\nIn summary, NVIDIA's revenue trends show a significant reliance on a major customer and a strong international market presence, while AMD's revenue trends indicate substantial growth driven by demand in specific product segments, particularly in gaming and data center markets.",

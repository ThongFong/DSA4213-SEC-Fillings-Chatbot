        "ticker_filter_manual": null,
        "response": {
            "answer": "Based on the provided context, we can observe the following revenue trends for NVIDIA and AMD:\n\n**NVIDIA:**\n1. **Customer Concentration:** NVIDIA's revenue is significantly influenced by a few key customers. In the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024, one customer accounted for 17% and 13% of total revenue, respectively. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, one customer represented 12% of total revenue, and another customer accounted for 11% of total revenue for the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. These revenues were primarily from the Compute & Networking segment.\n2. **Cost of Revenue:** NVIDIA's cost of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was $543 million and $473 million, respectively. For the first nine months, it was $1.3 billion and $734 million, respectively. This indicates an increase in cost of revenue over the periods mentioned.\n3. **Deferred Revenue:** NVIDIA's deferred revenue includes customer advances and unearned revenue related to various services and arrangements. The balance of customer advances as of October 27, 2024, and January 28, 2024, was $101 million and $233 million, respectively.\n\n**AMD:**\n1. **Segment Realignment:** Starting with the fiscal year ending December 27, 2025, AMD combined its Client and Gaming segments into one reportable segment. This change reflects how AMD manages its business.\n2. **Revenue Growth:** For the three months ended March 29, 2025, AMD reported net revenue of $7.4 billion, marking a 36% increase compared to the prior year period. This growth was driven by an increase in the Data Center segment revenue, primarily due to AMD EPYC\u2122 CPU and AMD Instinct\u2122 GPU sales, and an increase in the Client and Gaming segment revenue, driven by strong demand for the latest \u201cZen 5\u201d AMD Ryzen\u2122 processors. However, this was partially offset by a decrease in semi-custom revenue.\n3. **Embedded Segment:** AMD's Embedded segment revenue decreased due to mixed demand in end markets.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **Revenue Growth:** AMD experienced a significant 36% increase in net revenue for the three months ended March 29, 2025, driven by strong performance in its Data Center and Client and Gaming segments. In contrast, NVIDIA's revenue details focus more on customer concentration and cost of revenue, without specific growth percentages provided in the context.\n- **Customer Dependence:** NVIDIA's revenue is heavily dependent on a few key customers, which can be a risk if any of these customers reduce their orders. AMD's growth appears to be more diversified across different segments, particularly with strong demand in the Data Center and Client and Gaming segments.\n- **Cost and Deferred Revenue:** NVIDIA's cost of revenue has increased over the periods mentioned, and it has a notable amount of deferred revenue related to various services. The context does not provide specific cost details for AMD, but it highlights revenue growth and segment performance.\n\nOverall, AMD shows strong revenue growth driven by product demand and segment performance, while NVIDIA's revenue is significantly influenced by key customer relationships and increasing costs.",

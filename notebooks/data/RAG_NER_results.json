This increase was driven by growth in the Data Center segment, particularly from AMD EPYC\u2122 CPU and AMD Instinct\u2122 GPU sales, and in the Client and Gaming segment due to strong demand for \u201cZen 5\u201d AMD Ryzen\u2122 processors (Source 4).\n- Net revenue for the three months ended September 27, 2025, was $9.2 billion, also a 36% increase compared to the prior year period. This growth was driven by strong demand for AMD Ryzen\u2122 processors, semi-custom game console SoCs, Radeon\u2122 gaming GPUs, and 5th generation AMD EPYC\u2122 processors and AMD Instinct\u2122 MI350 Series GPUs (Source 5).\n\nIn summary, both companies experienced revenue growth, with NVIDIA's growth being significantly influenced by sales to major customers in the Compute & Networking segment, while AMD's growth was driven by strong demand across its Data Center and Client and Gaming segments.",

            "answer": "Based on the provided context, we can observe the following revenue trends for NVIDIA and AMD:\n\n**NVIDIA:**\n1. **Revenue Concentration:** NVIDIA's revenue is significantly concentrated, with two direct customers accounting for 12% and 11% of total revenue for the third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, respectively. This indicates a reliance on a few key customers, particularly in the Compute & Networking segment.\n2. **Cost of Revenue:** NVIDIA's cost of revenue for the third quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was $543 million and $473 million, respectively. For the first nine months, it was $1.3 billion and $734 million, respectively. This suggests an increase in cost of revenue year-over-year, which could imply higher sales or increased costs associated with production or services.\n\n**AMD:**\n1. **Revenue Growth:** AMD experienced a 36% increase in net revenue for both the three months ended March 29, 2025, and September 27, 2025, compared to the prior year periods. This growth was driven by increased demand in the Data Center segment, particularly for AMD EPYC\u2122 CPUs and AMD Instinct\u2122 GPUs, as well as strong demand in the Client and Gaming segment for AMD Ryzen\u2122 processors and Radeon\u2122 gaming GPUs.\n2. **Segment Performance:** The Client and Gaming segment showed strong performance due to demand for new processors and gaming products, while the Embedded segment saw a decrease due to mixed demand in end markets.\n3. **Gross Margin:** AMD's gross margin increased from 50% to 52% for the three months ended September 27, 2025, indicating improved profitability, likely due to a favorable product mix.\n\n**Comparison:**\n- **Growth Rate:** AMD shows a robust revenue growth rate of 36% year-over-year for the periods mentioned, driven by strong demand across multiple segments. In contrast, NVIDIA's revenue details are more focused on customer concentration and cost of revenue, without specific growth rates provided.\n- **Profitability:** AMD's increase in gross margin suggests improved profitability, whereas NVIDIA's data does not provide specific gross margin figures, focusing instead on cost of revenue.\n- **Market Focus:** Both companies are experiencing growth in data center and gaming-related products, but AMD's detailed segment performance highlights specific product lines contributing to growth, such as the AMD EPYC\u2122 and Ryzen\u2122 processors.\n\nOverall, AMD appears to be experiencing significant revenue growth and improved profitability, while NVIDIA's data highlights customer concentration and increased costs, without specific growth metrics.",

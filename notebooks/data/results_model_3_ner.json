These revenues were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment (Source 1 and Source 2).\n- The cost of revenue for NVIDIA was recorded as $543 million and $473 million for the third quarter, and $1.3 billion and $734 million for the first nine months of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively (Source 3).\n- During the second quarter of fiscal years 2025 and 2024, NVIDIA recorded $563 million and $232 million, respectively, in cost of revenue (Source 4).\n\n**AMD:**\n- For the three months ended March 29, 2025, AMD reported net revenue of $7.4 billion, which was a 36% increase compared to the prior year period. This increase was driven by growth in the Data Center segment, particularly from AMD EPYC\u2122 CPU and AMD Instinct\u2122 GPU sales, and an increase in the Client and Gaming segment revenue due to strong demand for the latest \u201cZen 5\u201d AMD Ryzen\u2122 processors. However, there was a decrease in semi-custom revenue, and Embedded segment revenue decreased due to mixed demand in end markets (Source 5).\n\nIn summary, NVIDIA's revenue trends show significant contributions from specific large customers in the Compute & Networking segment, while AMD experienced a substantial increase in overall net revenue driven by growth in its Data Center and Client and Gaming segments.",

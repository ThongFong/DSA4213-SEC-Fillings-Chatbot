This increase was driven by strong demand in the Client and Gaming segments, particularly for AMD Ryzen\u2122 processors, semi-custom game console SoCs, and Radeon\u2122 gaming GPUs, as well as an increase in Data Center segment revenue due to demand for AMD EPYC\u2122 processors and AMD Instinct\u2122 MI350 Series GPUs, as detailed in Source 4.\n\nIn summary, both companies experienced revenue growth, but AMD's growth was notably driven by increased demand in specific product segments, while NVIDIA's revenue was significantly influenced by sales to a major customer and international sales.",
